    "### What Is Dash?\n",
    "\n",
    "Dash is a library for building web apps for displaying data online in an interactive dashboard. Built on top of Python's Flask server, Dash allows you to create powerful  data visualization dashboards, which are rendered on HTML pages, called templates.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using Dash to create our data visualization dashboards throughout this course, but for now, let's take a look at the Dash code we just wrote.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we ran the line `app = Dash()`, we created a Dash app object. This object is the main entry point for our app, and it contains all the information about our app, including the layout it uses to output our HTML page.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we ran the line `app.run(debug=True)`, we started a web server that serves our app. That means that when we go to the website, our Dash app responds by sending the interface we've defined. This is what allows us to view our app in a web browser. The `debug=True` argument tells Dash to automatically reload the app when we make changes to the code, which is very useful for development. Let's see that in action now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try changing the text in the `html.H1()` line to something else, like \"My First Dash app at Noble! I think I might have nailed it.\" and save the file. You should see the app reload in your web browser, and the text should change to whatever you put in there. If you get an error message, make sure you saved the file before running it again, and double-check that your code is still correct."

Make sure the prompt says that you're in the `data-visualization-curriculum-main` folder—you'll see the word `data-visualization-curriculum-main` to the left of your cursor.

    "\n",
    "HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "We don't have to deeply understand HTML for this course, but we should start to get familiar with the part we'll be using extensively: elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. We just created a top-level heading element called an `h1` using the `html.H1` method call. The text inside the `h1` tag is the content of the heading, and, since it's a heading, the browser will display it in a large and bold font.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other common HTML elements include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `h2`,`h3`,`h4`: Lower-level headings (higher number = smaller font)\n",
    "- `p`: Paragraph (defines a paragarph of text)\n",
    "- `div`: Division (container for other elements)\n",
    "- `header`: Header (container for elements at the top of page)\n",
    "- `nav`: Nav (container for the page's nav links)\n",
    "- `main`: Main (container for elements in the middle of the page)\n",
    "- `section`: Section (container for related elements on the page)\n",
    "- `footer`: Footer (container for elements at the bottom of page)\n",
    "- `span`: Span (Inline container for text in the middle of a paragraph)\n",
    "- `a`: Anchor (a link to another page)\n",
    "- `img`: Image\n",
    "- `ul`: Unordered (bulleted) list\n",
    "- `ol`: Ordered (numbered) list\n",
    "- `li`: List item (one bullet point)\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using many of these elements in our Dash apps, but we won't need to know all of them. The most important ones to know are the `div` and `span` tags, as they are used to create containers for other elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't worry about memorizing this— we'll be using these elements in our Dash apps, and you'll get used to them as we go along. For now, just remember that HTML elements are the building blocks of web pages, and they are represented by tags."
